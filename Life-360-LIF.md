## Cryptoâ€™s long battle with SEC comes to a close with Ripple victory

- SEC has officially dropped its 4-year-old lawsuit against Ripple.  
- The case accused Ripple of raising $1.3B via XRP without registering it as a security.  
- Ripple spent $150 million fighting the SEC.  
- Charges against CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen were also dropped.

In December of 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple with the claim that Ripple sold XRP as an unregistered security. The conflict is in what each party considers XRP to be. While the SEC thinks of XRP as a security similar to a stock or bond that should have been registered with the SEC before being sold, Ripple argues that XRP is not a security but a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum. 

The ruling declared that while XRP sales to regular users and on exchanges are not considered securities, sales to institutional investors are considered securities and must comply with SEC laws. For programmatic sales via algorithms and public trades on exchanges, buyers do not have a direct connection to Ripple or a promise of profit, and, therefore, are not considered securities. 

For institutional investors, however, the SEC claimed that Ripple marketed XRP in such a way that implied a promise of profit. Ripple implied to institutional buyers that XRP would increase in value in an attempt to market XRP, and the institutional buyers relied on the efforts of Ripple to increase the value of their holdings in XRP. For this reason, the SEC declared XRP as a security in sales to institutional investors.
