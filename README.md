## Market Watches – Shivanshi Das
This repository showcases original market research written during my time as a Quantitative Analyst for Texas Undergraduate Computational Finance (UCF). Each Market Watch offers:

- Concise macroeconomic updates  
- Sector-specific analysis  
- A unique long or short investment thesis supported by data and technicals  

These reports aim to identify timely opportunities, explain market-moving events, and develop my investment research skills through real-time market writing.
